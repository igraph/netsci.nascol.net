# School / Workshop

Tutorial on cross-package network analysis in Python using [igraph](https://python.igraph.org), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) and [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/).

## Time

14:30 to 18:00 with a coffee break between 16:00–16:30.

## Instructors:

 - [Tamás Nepusz](http://github.com/ntamas/)
 - [Tiago Peixoto](https://skewed.de/tiago/)
 - [Matt Schwennesen](http://www.schwennesen.org/)

## Content

The workshop will be roughly broken up into three parts, one for each library.

### NetworkX

NetworkX is a pure-python library for network analysis which aims to be both
easy to install and easy to use while also being feature rich. Currently the
library features around 400 network analysis algorithms ranging from classics
like shortest path and spanning trees to approximate algorithms for problems
like graph isomorphism and the traveling salesperson problem. With the recent
addition of a backend system, NetworkX is now capable of utilizing faster
implementations of supported algorithms from other graph analysis libraries like
[Python GraphBLAS Algorithms](https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms) and
[CuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph/tree/branch-24.04/python/nx-cugraph).
In this workshop, we'll cover how to get started with NetworkX as well as topics
like graph visualization, some classical algorithms, graph input/output, a
network analysis case study and finally the new dispatching system.
